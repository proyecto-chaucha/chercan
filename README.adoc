# OP_RETURN Buffer API

This is a simple API for sending _OP_RETURN_ messages.
And retry them using a _cron job_ until they are notarized.

## Installation

`make install` or `make install-pip`

## Config

Configure the `.env` file

```sh
INPUT_PRIVKEY="" # Private key to sign the tx
INPUT_PUBKEY="" # Public key to get the amount
INPUT_SENDKEY="" # Public key to send the tx to
```

## Run

`make api` or `make nohup`

You can also check the link:Makefile{ext-relative}[Makefile] for additional commands.

## Endpoints

- `/?message=""`: Store the message in the _queue_.
- `/cron`: Execute OP_RETURN using the latest item inside _queue_. Setup a _cronjob_ to call this endpoint at least every 2 minutes.
- `/notary`: Show all the notarizations.
- `/history`: Show all the message stored (including non notarized ones).
