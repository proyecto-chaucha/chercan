# OP_RETURN Buffer API for Notarization

This is a simple API for sending _OP_RETURN_ messages.
And retry them using a _cron job_ until they are notarized.

This is a handy script because you could not send transactions
when you have no confirmations in the previous transaction.

With this buffer you can send any number of messages and they will
get to the _Chaucha_ blockchain eventually.

## Installation

`make install` or `make install-pip`

## Config

Configure the `.env` file

```sh
INPUT_PRIVKEY="" # Private key to sign the tx
INPUT_PUBKEY="" # Public key to get the amount
INPUT_SENDKEY="" # Public key to send the tx to
```

## Run

`make api` or `make nohup`

You can also check the link:Makefile{ext-relative}[Makefile] for additional commands.

## Endpoints

- `/?message=""`: Store the message in the _queue_.

Example:

`curl -i -X GET 'http:/0.0.0.0:8000/?message=holamundo'`

- `/cron`: Execute OP_RETURN using the latest item inside _queue_. Setup a _cronjob_ to call this endpoint at least every 2 minutes.

Example:

`curl -i -X GET 'http:/0.0.0.0:8000/cron'`

- `/notary`: Show all the notarizations.

Example:

`curl -i -X GET 'http:/0.0.0.0:8000/notary'`

- `/history`: Show all the message stored (including non notarized ones).

Example:

`curl -i -X GET 'http:/0.0.0.0:8000/history'`
